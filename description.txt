# Detailed Project Description

## Overview
The "Gym Landing Project" is a comprehensive web application designed to serve as a digital platform for the Zhengzhou University Gym. It combines a modern, user-friendly frontend with a robust backend to deliver a seamless experience for users. The project includes features such as gym service listings, membership plans, instructor profiles, and an AI-powered chatbot for user assistance. The application is built using cutting-edge technologies, ensuring scalability, maintainability, and responsiveness.

## Features
- **Frontend**: Built with React.js, Next.js, and SCSS for modular styling.
- **Backend**: Developed using FastAPI, featuring a chatbot powered by the LLaMA3 model.
- **AI Chatbot**: Provides gym-related assistance, including membership details and exercise guidance.
- **Responsive Design**: Optimized for various devices, ensuring a seamless user experience.
- **Dynamic Routing**: Utilizes Next.js capabilities for user-friendly URLs.
- **Component-Based Architecture**: Reusable components for maintainability and scalability.

## Project Structure
The project is organized into two main directories: `frontend` and `backend`. Each directory contains the necessary files and subdirectories to support the respective functionalities.

### Frontend
The frontend is built using React.js and Next.js, leveraging the power of server-side rendering and static site generation for optimal performance. The styling is managed using SCSS modules, ensuring a modular and maintainable approach to CSS.

#### Key Features
1. **Responsive Design**: The application is designed to be fully responsive, providing an optimal user experience across devices of various screen sizes.
2. **Dynamic Routing**: Next.js enables dynamic routing, allowing for the creation of user-friendly URLs.
3. **Component-Based Architecture**: The frontend is structured into reusable components, making it easy to maintain and extend.

#### Directory Structure
- **`components/`**: Contains reusable React components such as navigation menus, spinners, and various sections of the homepage.
  - `Menu.jsx`: Implements the navigation menu with links to different pages.
  - `Spinner.jsx`: A loading spinner component used across the application.
  - `seccion/`: A subdirectory containing components for specific sections like `Inicio`, `Ofertas`, `Planes`, etc.
- **`pages/`**: Contains the main pages of the application.
  - `_app.js`: The custom App component for initializing pages.
  - `index.jsx`: The homepage, showcasing gym services, plans, and instructors.
  - `ai-chatbot.jsx`: A dedicated page for interacting with the AI chatbot.
  - `about.jsx`: Provides detailed information about the gym and its founder.
- **`public/`**: Stores static assets such as images and videos.
  - `imgGym/`: Contains images related to gym activities and facilities.
  - `imgTeam/`: Includes images of gym instructors.
  - `videosGym/`: Stores promotional videos for various gym services.
- **`styles/`**: Contains SCSS modules for styling individual components and pages.

### Backend
The backend is developed using FastAPI, a modern web framework for building APIs with Python. It provides the necessary endpoints to support the frontend and integrates with an AI model for chatbot functionality.

#### Key Features
1. **API Endpoints**: The backend exposes RESTful APIs for various functionalities.
2. **AI Integration**: Utilizes the LLaMA3 model to power the chatbot, providing intelligent and context-aware responses.
3. **Middleware**: Implements CORS middleware to handle cross-origin requests during development.

#### Directory Structure
- **`main.py`**: The entry point of the backend application.
- **`__pycache__/`**: Contains compiled Python files for faster execution.

#### API Endpoints
1. **Root Endpoint (`/`)**: Returns a welcome message to confirm the server is running.
2. **Chat Endpoint (`/chat`)**: Handles user interactions with the chatbot, processing messages and returning relevant responses.

## Technologies Used
- **Frontend**: React.js, Next.js, SCSS, Node.js.
- **Backend**: Python, FastAPI, LLaMA3 model.
- **Styling**: SCSS modules for modular and maintainable CSS.
- **AI Model**: LLaMA3 for generating intelligent chatbot responses.

## Deployment
The application is designed to be easily deployable:
- **Frontend**: Can be deployed on platforms like Vercel, which is optimized for Next.js applications.
- **Backend**: Can be hosted on a server with Python and FastAPI support, ensuring scalability and reliability.
